title: "LiDAR API"

## Goal

We seek to find areas where LiDAR data has been collected on two occasions. Eventually we will use fire perimeter data to find areas where LiDAR was collected before and after a fire.

## Approach

I plan to use the R package from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) titled [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/) to interact with the [web API](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/tnmaccess/#/) provided by [The National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/lidar-explorer/#/).
